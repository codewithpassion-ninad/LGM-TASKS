Empowered users to discover new music based on their preferences and behaviors.

4. Image to Pencil Sketch:

Implemented a Python script to convert images into pencil sketch-like drawings.

Utilized image processing techniques to achieve realistic sketch transformations.

5. Exploratory Data Analysis:

I had the privilege to work on was Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset. It was a fascinating experience to delve into the data, uncover insights, and gain a deeper understanding of the patterns and trends related to terrorism incidents. 

In this repository I have conducted an insightful Exploratory Data Analysis on a Terrorism Dataset, extracting meaningful patterns and trends.

6. Iris Prediction using Decision Tree:

Built a predictive model using a decision tree algorithm to classify Iris flower species.

Achieved accurate predictions by analyzing flower features such as sepal length and width.

7. Handwriting Detection System:

As the sole architect behind this endeavor, I dived into the world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), crafting a sophisticated model that achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.76%. With every line of code and every layer of the network, I was driven by the vision of enhancing handwriting recognition.

The dataset, carefully selected from Kaggle, served as the cornerstone of this achievement. Through meticulous training and validation, the model has emerged as a reliable tool capable of deciphering the nuances of different handwriting styles.
