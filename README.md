The repository consists of all the tasks which are a part of Lets Grow More Internship.

1. Handwriting Detection System

As the sole architect behind this endeavor, I dived into the world of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs), crafting a sophisticated model that achieved a remarkable accuracy of 98.76%. With every line of code and every layer of the network, I was driven by the vision of enhancing handwriting recognition.

The dataset, carefully selected from Kaggle, served as the cornerstone of this achievement. Through meticulous training and validation, the model has emerged as a reliable tool capable of deciphering the nuances of different handwriting styles.

2. Exploratory Data Analysis

I had the privilege to work on was Exploratory Data Analysis on Terrorism Dataset. It was a fascinating experience to delve into the data, uncover insights, and gain a deeper understanding of the patterns and trends related to terrorism incidents. 

In this repository I have conducted an insightful Exploratory Data Analysis on a Terrorism Dataset, extracting meaningful patterns and trends.

3. Iris Classification

In this project, we embarked on a captivating journey into the realm of data classification using the Iris flower dataset. Leveraging the power of K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), Random Forest Classifier, and Support Vector Classifier, we achieved remarkable accuracy rates:

KNN Model Accuracy: 92.11% Random Forest Classifier Accuracy: 89.47% Support Vector Classifier Accuracy: 94.73% Each model demonstrated its unique strengths, contributing to the precision and reliability of our predictions. This project not only deepened our understanding of classification techniques but also unveiled the potential of data-driven insights in deciphering the world of flora. ðŸŒ¿ðŸŒ¸
